# arduino-gsm900
Code to send and receive SMS with the Arduino shield 900.
You need the Shield GSM 900.
This code receives the number you want to send  between # and $, like #+549314236478$
where +54 is the country code, 931 is my city code and 4236478 is the phone number.
then you need to send the text between %&, like $Hello world%

when you receive, is the same..

Thank you for reading it, any suggestion send it!
